# BOOKS

[DEMO](https://strive-booksapi.imfast.io/)

You are creating the "shopping cart experience" for a Online Marketplace.
You have the list of the available books from the current API:
https://striveschool.herokuapp.com/books

What you have to do is:

- Get all the products from the API using a fetch

- Display the list of items available on the page using template literals `` and .forEach

- Add a "add to cart button"
- When the button is pressed, change the style of the item and add it to another list

- Add "skip" button next to each item
- When pressed, the button should remove from the page the item not interesting from the user
- Add a "search bar". When the user types more than 3 chars, you should filter the content of the page to show only the items with a matching name (hint: use .filter method)
- Allow the user to delete items from the cart list

- Add a "clean cart" button, to clean the whole list.
- Create a second "detail page" for the product. When the user clicks on a product name, the app should redirect him to the secondary page, passing the ASIN in query string

- In page "detail" show some details of the selected product

# DAY 2


### DESCRIPTION
Start from your previous Spotify Exercise.
The goal of this exercise is to fetch data from the API instead of having them "wired up" in the page.

Generate automatically 3 lists based on the "search API" response

es.: https://deezerdevs-deezer.p.rapidapi.com/search?q=eminem
es.: https://deezerdevs-deezer.p.rapidapi.com/search?q=metallica
es.: https://deezerdevs-deezer.p.rapidapi.com/search?q=behemoth

Load them during page load, and create the collections based on the API response.
